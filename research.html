<b>Dynamic 3D Bacterial Movement Mapping</b>

<p>
My research harnesses Digital Holographic Microscopy (DHM) to investigate microbial behaviors in 3D aquatic ecosystems. 
This study focuses on developing an innovative 4D tracking method for microorganisms, which is both accurate and computationally efficient. 
Leveraging volumetric imaging, this approach offers a non-invasive observation technique, eliminating traditional staining or labeling of microbes. 
A key advantage of DHM is its ability to simultaneously track multiple microbes, with limitations only set by the camera's frame rate. 
This technology also provides critical insights into microbial shapes and biophysical parameter shifts, vital for understanding population dynamics. 
The development of advanced algorithms within this project is crucial for a deeper understanding of microbial dynamics in complex ecosystems, marking a significant stride in microbial ecology and aquatic ecosystem studies.

<b>Interplay Between Phytoplankton and Bacteria in 3D</b>
<br>

<p>
Phytoplankton-bacteria relationships are critical to aquatic ecosystems, underpinning nutrient cycling and oxygen production. 
Phytoplankton, Earth's primary photosynthesis agents, contribute to ocean health by providing food for marine organisms and generating oxygen. 
Bacteria, ubiquitous single-celled microorganisms, aid in nutrient recycling, organic matter decomposition, and compound production in various ocean habitats. 
Their complex and dynamic interactions range from mutualistic, with phytoplankton providing organic compounds for bacteria, to antagonistic, where certain bacteria can harm phytoplankton via toxins or resource competition. 
To fully understand these interactions, it's essential to quantify and observe them in three dimensions. 
In my work, I focus on the development of advanced tracking algorithms that are specifically designed for the simultaneous observation of microorganisms with significantly different morphologies.

<b>Three-Dimensional Flagellar Motion Analysis</b>
<br>
<img src="./images/project_flagellar.png" height="420" width="420" align="right" hspace="10"/>
<p>
Understanding the rapid, three-dimensional movements of eukaryotic flagella is crucial for deciphering eukaryotic cell survival mechanisms. 
Traditional methods falter in accurately defining flagella's intricate structure due to limitations in pinpointing 3D positions. 
Our approach, employing digital holographic microscopy (DHM), effectively addresses this challenge. 
It facilitates dynamic 3D tracking of eukaryotic cell flagella, capturing their shape and motility with precision. 
By leveraging DHM's capabilities for high-speed imaging across extensive sample volumes, our method achieves 4D tracking (X, Y, Z, and time) of microorganisms and their flagella.
